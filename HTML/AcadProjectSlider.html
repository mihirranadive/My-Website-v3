                            <p class="ProjectBody">Worked on various software projects. Main technologies used were C#/.NET and SQL server 2008. All work done was related to web technologies, hence, time and again work with HTML, JavaScript etc was required. One of the best things that came out of this experience is learning effective communication between the team and others as well as learning how things work together in a rather large company.</p>

Work done was creation of a mobile view website for the KPIT staff to search and access assets like files, information etc from their cell phone devices. Web pages were built on their SharePoint Server 2003 Platform. Technologies used were C#/.NET, SQL Server 2003, JavaScript and of course some HTML and CSS.</p>

                            <p class="ProjectBody">Under this course various projects and algorithm implementations were done. Some of the algorithms implemented as part of this course were Chandy-Lamport, Ricart-Agrawala, Roucairol-Carvholo, Jajodia-Mutchler. The main take-back from the course, however, was the knowledge and challenges faced when implementing Multithreading and Socket programming. Especially UDP based protocol (where required). All programming was done in Java. Code had to be implemented on a host of university machines in order to show protocols worked and the algorithms executed when the nodes would either communicate, demand a resource etc. </p>

Implementations in terms of projects include SVMs, Perceptrons, ADA-boost, ID3 and Naive-bayes. All implementations were done in Java. The take-back from this course was data representation and analysis also used similarly in Data mining kind of applications.
